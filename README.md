# Fake-News-Detector
We trained our model on the combined.csv dataset, which contains a mixture of real and fake news articles. To further analyze the relationships among the news articles, we constructed a graph-based network where each node represents a news article. The edges between nodes were established based on cosine similarity, quantifying the degree of textual similarity between pairs of articles. This similarity-based graph enabled us to visualize and explore the structure of the fake news network, highlighting how individual articles are contextually related to one another.
